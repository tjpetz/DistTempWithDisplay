# Display Distance, Temperature, and Humidity

A simple Arduino project using:
- DHT-11 temparature and humidty sensor
- HC-SR04 sonic ranging sensor
- LCD 16X2 display

Note, this is a work in progress.  It will evolve over time frome something very simple to something a bit more complex including ideally an approach to task management on the Arduino.
